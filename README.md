# Predicting greenhouse gas concentration and surface temperature with CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM models 


## Objective
* Unravel how spatial information on greenhouse gases can enhance our ability to estimate temperature. 
* Identify areas where spatial information encounters challenges in estimation.
* Explore the potential of leveraging temporal data on greenhouse gas (CO2) to refine concentration estimates on a monthly scale.
